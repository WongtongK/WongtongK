# 👩‍💻 Karina | Full-stack Developer | Metalhead with a Compiler

```csharp
// Warning: Highly caffeinated code wizard ahead ☕

Hi! I'm Karina – a 24-year-old full-stack sorceress currently on my 4th semester of Computer Science, and I've already befriended both the front-end and the back-end beasts. When I'm not typing furiously into VSCode or debugging the space-time continuum, I'm probably:

🎸 Shredding on my guitar
☕ Sipping dangerously strong coffee with friends
🏋️ Lifting more than just spirits at the gym
🤘 Screaming along at a metal concert (or in the terminal...)

🔧 Tech I Speak Fluently
Languages & Frameworks: C#, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, .NET

Architectures: Domain-Centric, Microservices, SOLID, OOP

Dev Tools: Docker, JWT, CMS, Entity Framework

Security Minded: OWASP Top 10, Cybersecurity

Protocols & Layers: TCP/IP, OSI Model

Team Player: SCRUM, Agile, Code Reviews, GitHub Actions

🧠 Programmer Personality
MBTI: ENTJ
Strategic. Visionary. Command-line queen.
But also the kind of person who names their functions something like voidSummonMetalGods() just for fun. 🦇

🤘 Fun Fact
I write clean code... but listen to dirty riffs.
Call me a contradiction, but I compile just fine. 😉
